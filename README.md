# Interactive Resume / Portfolio Website
This repo contains my Interactive Resume website. It is purely a frontend project that is built with ReactJS. It does however use [GitHub GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/) to get information about my repositories. Using Github's API means that the website will be up to date with all my current repositories. You can view the live version [here](https://phaze1d.github.io/Interactive-Resume/)

## Development
You can easily modify a bit of the code to display anyone's Github information if there profile and repositories are public but remember that not all of the information comes from Github. For example, the bio, education, work, skills, and PDF Resume will have to be changed manually. To get started with development just follow this steps.

1. Fork or Clone the repository
2. In the root directory install the npm dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the webpack dev server with `npm run start`
