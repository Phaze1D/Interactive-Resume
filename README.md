# Interactive-Resume

This is my Interactive Resume for the [Udacity Frontend Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree/).
It is an exacted replica of the current terminal setup that I have.

### To Run Production Build:
  Just open build/index.html file. Please not that do to cross-domain protection the print command will not work

### To Run Development Build:
  You need to have npm install if you want to run the development version which allows the print function
  
#### To install npm modules
```sh
  npm install
```

#### To start the development build
```sh
  npm run start
```
The site will be running on localhost:3000
