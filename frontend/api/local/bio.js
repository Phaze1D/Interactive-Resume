	about: `
	Since I was a kid I have always loved to do 2 things, create and solve. I go into computers the moment my dad got one for his work and I immediately wanted to know how it worked in the hopes of building one myself. While research computers I came across the software side of things, which was a perfect fit for me, a way I could create and solve.
